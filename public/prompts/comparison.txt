Compare the following two texts, Text 1 and Text 2, based on the criteria of simplicity, formality, and positive connotation. For each divergent passage, assign a score to each criterion using a scale from 1 to 10, where:

5 indicates both texts have the same level for the given criterion.

A score below 5 indicates that Text 1 has a higher level for the given criterion.

A score above 5 indicates that Text 2 has a higher level for the given criterion.

Additionally, calculate an overall score for each criterion, reflecting the general trend across all differences.

Texts:

Text 1:
{inputText1}

Text 2:
{inputText2}

Differences:

{differences}
