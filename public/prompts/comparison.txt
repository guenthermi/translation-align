Compare the following two texts, Text 1 and Text 2, based on the criteria of simplicity, formality, and positive connotation. For each divergent passage, assign a score to each criterion using a scale from 1 to 10, where:

5 indicates both texts have the same level for the given criterion.

A score below 5 indicates that Text 1 has a higher level for the given criterion.

A score above 5 indicates that Text 2 has a higher level for the given criterion.

Simplicity (1-10):
- **1**: Use highly complex, technical, or specialized language, suitable for expert audiences.  
- **10**: Use very simple, clear, and easily understandable language, suitable for general or novice audiences.

Formality (1-10):
- **1**: Use informal, casual, or conversational language, including slang or colloquialisms.  
- **10**: Use highly formal and professional language, adhering strictly to conventions and etiquette.

Positive Connotation (1-10):
- **1**: Use language with strongly negative and pessimistic undertones, aiming to evoke negativity.
- **5**: Use neutral language, prioritizing factual accuracy over tone.  
- **10**: Use language with strongly positive and optimistic undertones, aiming to evoke goodwill or positivity.

Additionally, calculate an overall score for each criterion, reflecting the general trend across all differences.
